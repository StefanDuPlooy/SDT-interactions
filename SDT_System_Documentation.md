## System Architecture

The application consists of:
- **Frontend**: React-based dashboard with Material-UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence

## Simulation Engine and Mechanics

### Core Simulation Logic
**Location**: `backend/src/services/SimulationEngine.ts`

The simulation engine is the heart of the system, responsible for generating realistic student interaction data based on various factors and algorithms.

### Student Modeling

**Student Attributes**:
- **Academic Level**: Undergraduate or Postgraduate
- **Major**: Randomly assigned from predefined list
- **Current GPA**: 2.0-4.0 scale
- **Risk Level**: Low (60%), Medium (25%), High (15%)
- **Personality Type**: Extrovert (30%), Introvert (30%), Ambivert (40%)
- **Participation Score**: 0-100 baseline engagement metric

### Interaction Generation Algorithm

**Base Configuration**:
```typescript
baseInteractionProbability: 0.1 (10% base chance)
personalityFactors: {
  extrovert: 1.5x multiplier
  introvert: 0.7x multiplier
  ambivert: 1.0x multiplier
}
contextFactors: {
  lecture: 0.3x (limited interaction)
  tutorial: 0.8x (moderate interaction)
  lab: 0.9x (high interaction)
  group-work: 1.2x (highest interaction)
}
```

**Interaction Probability Calculation**:
1. Start with base probability (10%)
2. Apply personality factors for both students
3. Apply special rules (e.g., introvert-introvert pairs get 0.5x multiplier)
4. Apply context multiplier based on session type
5. Apply academic similarity bonus (GPA difference < 0.5 gets 1.2x multiplier)
6. Apply risk-based modifiers
7. Cap maximum probability at 70%

**Activity Peaks**: Each session type has predefined activity peaks when interactions are more likely:
- **Lecture**: 10%, 50%, 90% of session duration
- **Group Work**: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% of session duration
- **Lab**: 30%, 70% of session duration
- **Tutorial**: 20%, 60% of session duration

**Interaction Types**: Generated based on context:
- **Discussion**: General conversation
- **Collaboration**: Working together on tasks
- **Social**: Non-academic social interaction
- **Help-seeking**: One student asking for assistance

**Duration Modeling**: Context-based average durations with Â±50% variation:
- Lecture: 15 seconds average
- Tutorial: 60 seconds average
- Lab: 120 seconds average
- Group Work: 180 seconds average

### Network Analysis

**Metrics Calculated**:
1. **Network Density**: Actual connections / Possible connections
2. **Centrality Scores** for each student:
   - **Degree Centrality**: Direct connections / Total possible connections
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: How often a student lies on paths between others
   - **Closeness Centrality**: Average distance to all other students
   - **Eigenvector Centrality**: Influence based on connections to other influential students

3. **Clustering Coefficient**: Measure of how connected a student's neighbors are to each other
4. **Connected Components**: Number of separate sub-networks

### Engagement Metrics Generation

**Per-Student Metrics Calculated**:
- **Interaction Frequency**: Interactions per hour
- **Average Interaction Duration**: Mean duration of all interactions
- **Social Network Position**: Degree centrality score
- **Behavioral Patterns**:
  - Whether student initiates interactions
  - Whether student responds to interactions
  - Isolation risk assessment

**Risk Assessment Algorithm**:
- **GPA Contribution** (0-40 points):
  - < 2.0 GPA: +40 risk points
  - 2.0-2.5 GPA: +25 risk points
  - 2.5-3.0 GPA: +10 risk points

- **Participation Contribution** (0-30 points):
  - < 30% participation: +30 risk points
  - 30-50% participation: +20 risk points
  - 50-70% participation: +10 risk points

- **Social Isolation Contribution** (0-30 points):
  - Based on network centrality and interaction frequency

**Risk Flags Generated**:
- Academic: `low_gpa`, `low_participation`, `social_isolation`
- Social: `social_isolation`, `no_interactions`, `introvert_underengagement`

### Session Generation Process

1. **Initialize Session**: Create unique session ID and timestamp
2. **Generate Students**: Create student profiles with random attributes
3. **Create Interaction Timeline**: Generate interactions based on activity peaks
4. **Calculate Probabilities**: For each student pair, calculate interaction probability
5. **Generate Interactions**: Create interaction events based on probabilities
6. **Compute Network Metrics**: Analyze the generated interaction network
7. **Generate Engagement Metrics**: Calculate individual student metrics
8. **Return Complete Session**: Package all data for API response

### API Endpoints

**Session Generation**: `POST /api/simulate/session`
- Input validation using Joi schema
- Accepts session parameters (course ID, type, duration, student list)
- Returns complete session object with interactions and metrics

**Session Retrieval**: `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId`
- Currently returns 404 (database integration pending)

**Engagement Metrics**: `GET /api/students/:studentId/sessions/:sessionId/engagement`
- Currently returns 501 (implementation pending)
